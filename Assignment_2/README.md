This assignment consists of two Python notebook files. One for the image filtering part of assignment 2, and the other for the build CNN part.


The notebooks should work right out of the gate with either Jupyter or local Python environments. If any libraries are missing, libraries used, such as TorchViz, are commented out in the cell right before they are used, making it easy to run before implementation.


If you want to use the test PNG instead of building JPEG, just switch the comments and run again.
